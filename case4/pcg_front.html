                        <p>
                        <img src = "blake.jpg" alt="Laura Blake">
                        Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite
                        field of the best long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr.
                        28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record set last year
                        by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third,
                        respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the 
                        NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for 
                        Colorado State. 
                        <p>
                        In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used
                        a finishing kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year, in 
                        a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of Billings,
                        Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu
                        of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This year's race 
                        through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with
                        over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity
                        and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.

                        <h3>Highway 7 Reopens</h3>
                        <p>
                        Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection. A late 
                        blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the
                        highway's reopening. Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main 
                        link between Estes Park and Grand Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual 
                        signs that summer is near and the tourist season will soon be upon us!

                        <h3>Cougar Sightings Increase</h3>
                        <p>
                        Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released 
                        yesterday by the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes 
                        Park and the surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to 
                        only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year. 
                        <p>Reasons for the growing number 
                        of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats 
                        and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken
                        by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        DNR spokesman 
                        Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe they have
                        seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in the west
                        this year from cougar attacks.

                        <h3>If You Encounter a Cougar</h3>
                        <p>
                        Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase. Try to appear larger than 
                        the cougar by raising your arms. Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar 
                        that you are not prey, but a potential danger. In case of an attack, stay on your feet and 
                        fight back aggressively. 
                        <p>
